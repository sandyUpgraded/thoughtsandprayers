My effort to make government more efficient. 

I wrote a script that queries Twitter trending topics across the United States and seeks the phrase (in this case, "shooting"). If there is a shooting as a trending topic, it automates a tweet of "My thoughts and prayers go to the victims of this senseless tragedy." Note to members of Congress: this is legit. This ain't the Obamacare website--this code works and I'm giving it away for free on GitHub, because that's what we seem to do quite a bit out here in Northern California. We give cool stuff away for free. You just need to configure it to your Twitter account. It doesn't make a difference if you're a PC user or Mac, iOS or Android. It's Javascript, you can stick in on an AWS server running NodeJS (no, Hillary, not your home server, please), and it'll just keep checking for more violence every hour. It's great, because it matches the extent of what you've accomplished between Sandy Hook and now, but you don't need to risk hurting your fingers tapping away on your phone. You don't run the risk of sticking your foot in your mouth like the Lt. Governor of Texas did. Now you can completely ignore the lives lost. As one "low-energy" candidate for President once said, "stuff happens". Well, now it doesn't have to distract you from another doomed vote to repeal Obamacare.

And for people just looking to work with Twitter, it is a nice, easy script to get you scanning trending topics and pushing an action...
